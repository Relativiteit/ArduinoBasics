For the projects the Elegoo complete starter pack is recommended however you can also only buy the necessarry parts for the projects you want to complete.

## Project Structure
The projects will have a small introduction on what is the expected outcome, and a Bill of Materials. 
You can search on project name, or project x and go up accordingly. 
* Projects 1-2 are LED projects
You can also search on BOM based on the projects, the BOMx corresponds with the project number. 



## Project 1: Button Led 
This is the "Hello World!" of electronics. 
`ButtonLedProject1` is your first program where a normally closed button is pressed so it switches to open and the Led will stop shining bright.

### BOM1 (Bill of Materials Button Led)
* Arduino Uno 
* Breadboard 
* Wires
* Led
* Digital button with 4 pins
* 10k ohm resistor 
* 220 ohm resistor 

## Project 2: Light Dimmer
Who doesn't like a good light dimmer while listing to Bruno Mars on a summers night. 
As the name `LightDimmerProject2` suggests the led as seen in project 1 can now be controlled with an analog potentiometer. In the case of the humble LED you can't actually dimm the lumen(light power) but you can controll the frequency of the led turning on and off also called PWM (pulse width modulation). With our "inferior to robots" eyes this lenght at with a signal is kept high within the pulse will create the illusion of a dimming light source. 

### BOM2 (Bill of Materials Light Dimmer)
* Arduino Uno 
* Breadboard
* Wires
* Led
* 10k ohm potentiometer 
* 330 ohm resitor 

**Attention**If you dont have the exact resistor you can place them in series or paralell to get the correct or approximate required resistance. ! If all of this sounds new to you please check https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-circuit-analysis-topic/ee-resistor-circuits/a/ee-parallel-resistors so you can get up and running fast.
